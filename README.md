Algorithm for Music Recommendation System in JLU Comprehensive Practice of Software Development.

Our Algorithm is mainly based on Collaborative Filtering(CF). It is composed of 3 parts: User-based CF, Item-based CF and Latent Factor Model.

*UserCF* & *ItemCF* are implemented in CollaborativeFiltering.py, while *LFM* is implemented in MatrixDecomposition.py.
